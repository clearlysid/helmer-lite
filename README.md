Helmer Micro is a cross-platform GIF recording app. It's open-source and built using the awesome [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) framework, [Gifski](https://github.com/ImageOptim/gifski) the GIF encoder, and our high-performance capture engine [scap](https://github.com/helmerapp/scap).

## Motivation

GIFs are clearly the internet's favourite file format, but notoriously hard to create. We, the team behind [Helmer](https://www.helmer.app), wanted to create a small tool to make it easy and effortless for everyone!

Alongside our tiny quest this app is also:

1. a demo of our libraries [scap](https://github.com/helmerapp/scap) and [henx](https://github.com/helmerapp/henx) üõ†Ô∏è
2. a call to make more OSS apps that are beautifully designed! üíñ

## COSS?

Yup, Commercial Open-source Software!

Many of the tools and libraries we author are made available to everyone and kept updated though Github. We believe in operating with transparency, building alongside our community and supporting peer OSS projects along the way. This way everyone collectively benefits and we can improve each other's work instead of running in circles within our own walled gardens.

If you'd like to support us, we request that you buy a license via [our website](https://www.helmer.app/micro) ‚Äî it will allow us to become a sustainable business and eventually count towards a credible way of funding our work and experiments.

Of course, you are more than welcome to build your own binaries using our source code for free! Please reach out in the `#micro` channel on our Discord if you need help setting this up.

Lastly: don't forget to share your GIFs online with a `#MadeWithMicro` hashtag, we'd love to see what you make! ü´∂
